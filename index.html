                A spiritual genius of commanding intellect and power, Swami
                Vivekananda crammed immense labor and achievement into his
                short life (1863–1902). Born Narendranath Datta, Vivekananda
                in his youth was fascinated by the agnostic Western schools of
                philosophy.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the same time, vehement in his desire to know the truth
                about God, he questioned people of holy reputation, asking
                them if they had seen God. He found such a person in Sri
                Ramakrishna, who became his master, allayed his doubts, guided
                him on the spiritual path, and transformed him into sage and
                prophet with authority to teach.
              </p>

              <p>
                After Sri Ramakrishna's passing in 1886, Vivekananda renounced
                the world and crisscrossed India as a wandering monk. His
                mounting compassion for India's people drove him to seek
                material help from the West. Accepting an opportunity to
                represent Hinduism at Chicago's Parliament of Religions in
                1893, Vivekananda won instant celebrity in America and a ready
                forum for his spiritual teaching.
              </p>

              <p>
                For three years he spread the Vedanta philosophy and religion
                in America and England and then returned to India to found the
                Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. He passed away on
                July 4, 1902, after a brief second visit to the West. His
                lectures and writings have been gathered into nine volumes of
                his Complete Works.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most of the Vedanta Societies which were founded in America
                and Europe up through the 1930s can trace their origins
                directly to Swami Vivekananda or the people who heard him
                speak from 1893 through 1900.

                    <p>
                      Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta (shortened to
                      Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali family at his ancestral
                      home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the
                      capital of British India, on
                      <b>12 January 1863</b> during the Makar Sankranti
                      festival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine
                      siblings.His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney
                      at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta,
                      Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian
                      scholar who left his family and became a monk at age
                      twenty-five.His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout
                      housewife.The progressive, rational attitude of
                      Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his
                      mother helped shape his thinking and personality.

                <em>1879</em>
                <p>
                  In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the
                  only student to receive first-division marks in the
                  Presidency College entrance examination. He was an avid
                  reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy,
                  religion, history, social science, art and literature. He
                  was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the
                  Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the
                  Mahabharata and the Puranas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and
                  regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and
                  organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic,
                  Western philosophy and European history at the General
                  Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church

                    <p>
                      At the threshold of youth Narendra had to pass through a
                      period of spiritual crisis when he was assailed by
                      doubts about the existence of God. It was at that time
                      he first heard about Sri Ramakrishna from one of his
                      English professors at college.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One day in November 1881, Narendra went to meet Sri
                      Ramakrishna who was staying at the Kali Temple in
                      Dakshineshwar. He straightaway asked the Master a
                      question which he had put to several others but had
                      received no satisfactory answer: “Sir, have you seen
                      God?” Without a moment’s hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna
                      replied: “Yes, I have. I see Him as clearly as I see
                      you, only in a much intenser sense.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Apart from removing doubts from the mind of Narendra,
                      Sri Ramakrishna won him over through his pure, unselfish
                      love. Thus began a guru-disciple relationship which is
                      quite unique in the history of spiritual masters.
                      Narendra now became a frequent visitor to Dakshineshwar
                      and, under the guidance of the Master, made rapid
                      strides on the spiritual path. At Dakshineshwar,
                      Narendra also met several young men who were devoted to
                      Sri Ramakrishna, and they all became close friends.

                      After a few years two events took place which caused
                      Narendra considerable distress. One was the sudden death
                      of his father in 1884. This left the family penniless,
                      and Narendra had to bear the burden of supporting his
                      mother, brothers and sisters. The second event was the
                      illness of Sri Ramakrishna which was diagnosed to be
                      cancer of the throat.

                      In September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to a house
                      at Shyampukur, and a few months later to a rented villa
                      at Cossipore. In these two places the young disciples
                      nursed the Master with devoted care. In spite of poverty
                      at home and inability to find a job for himself,
                      Narendra joined the group as its leader.

                      After the Master’s passing, fifteen of his young
                      disciples (one more joined them later) began to live
                      together in a dilapidated building at Baranagar in North
                      Kolkata. Under the leadership of Narendra, they formed a
                      new monastic brotherhood, and in 1887 they took the
                      formal vows of sannyasa, thereby assuming new names.
                      Narendra now became Swami Vivekananda (although this
                      name was actually assumed much later.)

                      During his travels all over India, Swami Vivekananda was
                      deeply moved to see the appalling poverty and
                      backwardness of the masses. He was the first religious
                      leader in India to understand and openly declare that
                      the real cause of India’s downfall was the neglect of
                      the masses. The immediate need was to provide food and
                      other bare necessities of life to the hungry millions.
                      For this they should be taught improved methods of
                      agriculture, village industries, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It was in this context that Vivekananda grasped the crux
                      of the problem of poverty in India (which had escaped
                      the attention of social reformers of his days): owing to
                      centuries of oppression, the downtrodden masses had lost
                      faith in their capacity to improve their lot. It was
                      first of all necessary to infuse into their minds faith
                      in themselves.

                    <p>
                      Swami Vivekananda heard about the World’s Parliament of
                      Religions to be held in Chicago in 1893. His friends and
                      admirers in India wanted him to attend the Parliament.
                      He too felt that the Parliament would provide the right
                      forum to present his Master’s message to the world, and
                      so he decided to go to America. Another reason which
                      prompted Swamiji to go to America was to seek financial
                      help for his project of uplifting the masses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Swamiji, however, wanted to have an inner certitude and
                      divine call regarding his mission. Both of these he got
                      while he sat in deep meditation on the rock-island at
                      Kanyakumari. With the funds partly collected by his
                      Chennai disciples and partly provided by the Raja of
                      Khetri, Swami Vivekananda left for America from Mumbai
                      on 31 May 1893.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      His speeches at the World’s Parliament of Religions held
                      in September 1893 made him famous as an ‘orator by
                      divine right’ and as a ‘Messenger of Indian wisdom to
                      the Western world’. After the Parliament, Swamiji spent
                      nearly three and a half years spreading Vedanta as lived
                      and taught by Sri Ramakrishna, mostly in the eastern
                      parts of USA and also in London.

                        to rouse the religious consciousness of the people and
                        create in them pride in their cultural heritage</u>2)<u>
                        to bring about unification of Hinduism by pointing out
                        the common bases of its sects</u>3)<u>to focus the attention of educated people on the
                        plight of the downtrodden masses, and to expound his
                        plan for their uplift by the application of the
                        principles of Practical Vedanta</u>.

                      In early 1898 Swami Vivekananda acquired a big plot of
                      land on the western bank of the Ganga at a place called
                      Belur to have a permanent abode for the monastery and
                      monastic Order originally started at Baranagar, and got
                      it registered as Ramakrishna Math after a couple of
                      years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here Swamiji established a new, universal pattern of
                      monastic life which adapts ancient monastic ideals to
                      the conditions of modern life, which gives equal
                      importance to personal illumination and social service,
                      and which is open to all men without any distinction of
                      religion, race or caste.

                      The rest of his life was spent in India, inspiring and
                      guiding people, both monastic and lay. Incessant work,
